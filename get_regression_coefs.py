def get_regression_coefs(Y, x1, x2, x3=None):
    """
    Compute coefficients for trend regressions.

    Given a vector `Y` and a collection of regressors `*args`, return vector of coefficients `coefs`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Y : (T,) array that will be the dependent variable. In our example, either GDP per capita in
    level or in logs.
    
    *args : N arrays of dimension (T,) that are the regressors. For example, the first array will be
    a (T,) array with elements of ones. 
    
    Note: *args is a convenient Python command to flexibly allow
    for different number of inputs into a function. That is, `get_regression_coefs(Y, x1, x2)` will
    give us args = `(x1, x2)` while `get_regression_coefs(Y, x1, x2, x3)` will give us args = `(x1,
    x2, x3)`. This allows us to use the same function for all different specifications.

    Returns
    -------
    coefs: This returns the array of coefficients. If we input two regressors (i.e. `x1` and `x2`),
    then coefs = `(a, b)`. If we input three regressors (i.e. `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`), then coefs =
    `(a, b1, b2)`. Ordering `x1` as the vector of ones ensures that `a` is the intercept.
